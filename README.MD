Sure! Here's an example of a README file explaining a project:

# Bank Note Fraud Prediction Using NN and TesnsorFLow

## Description

This project is an implementation of a machine learning model for gender classification. It uses a 1-hidden layer neural network with adaptive activation function selection based on the dataset. The model can learn the best activation function by exploring a flexible functional form `k0 + k1 * x` with parameters `k0` and `k1` learned from multiple runs.
